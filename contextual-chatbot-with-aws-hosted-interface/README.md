## Project Overview

Modern chatbots have revolutionized customer service by providing 24/7 support using advanced natural language capabilities through Large Language Models (LLMs). While basic question-answering chatbots have limitations, integration with internal knowledge bases and information systems enables more contextual and personalized conversations. The implementation of [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-customize-rag.html) (RAG) architecture, particularly through services like [Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/), allows chatbots to provide more accurate and relevant responses by grounding them in factual information from existing data sources.

### Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock

[Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/) is a serverless option to build powerful conversational AI systems using RAG. It offers fully managed data ingestion and text generation workflows. 

For data ingestion, it handles creating, storing, managing, and updating text embeddings of document data in the vector database automatically. It splits the documents into manageable chunks for efficient retrieval. The chunks are then converted to embeddings and written to a vector index, while allowing you to see the source documents when answering a question. 

For text generation, Amazon Bedrock provides the [RetrieveAndGenerate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_RetrieveAndGenerate.html) API to create embeddings of user queries, and retrieves relevant chunks from the vector database to generate accurate responses. It also supports source attribution and short-term memory needed for RAG applications.

## Part 2 - Deploying a Serverless Streamlit Application

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying a Streamlit web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). Streamlit is a popular Python library for creating web applications with minimal code, and CDK is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that simplifies the process of provisioning and managing AWS resources.

#### Create Amazon CodeBuild Project to deploy Streamlit Application on Amazon ECS

1. Open [AWS CloudShell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/).

2. Create an AWS IAM Service Role for AWS CodeBuild

    Observe that the same IAM policy attached to logged in user role is attached to CodeBuild's Service Role as well.

    ```bash
    cat << 'EOF' > codebuild-trust-policy.json
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "Service": "codebuild.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
    }
    EOF

    aws iam create-role --role-name CodeBuildServiceRole-$AWS_REGION --assume-role-policy-document file://codebuild-trust-policy.json

    aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name CodeBuildServiceRole-$AWS_REGION --policy-arn $(aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name $(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Arn' --output text | cut -d'/' -f2) --query 'AttachedPolicies[0].PolicyArn' --output text)
    ```

2. Create an AWS CodeBuild project using Amazon S3 as source and start building the project

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Account' --output text)
    aws codebuild create-project \
    --name "contextual-chatbot-with-aws-hosted-interface" \
    --source "{
        \"type\": \"S3\",
        \"location\": \"codebuild-s3-source-$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID/contextual-chatbot-with-aws-hosted-interface.zip\",
        \"buildspec\": \"buildspec.yml\"
    }" \
    --artifacts "{
        \"type\": \"NO_ARTIFACTS\"
    }" \
    --environment "{
        \"type\": \"LINUX_CONTAINER\",
        \"image\": \"aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:5.0\",
        \"computeType\": \"BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL\",
        \"privilegedMode\": true
    }" \
    --service-role $(aws iam get-role --role-name CodeBuildServiceRole-$AWS_REGION --query 'Role.Arn' --output text)

    aws codebuild start-build --project-name "contextual-chatbot-with-aws-hosted-interface"
    ```

Navigate to [AWS CodeBuild](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects) to see the logs.

**If this is your first time deploying it, the process may take approximately 15-20 minutes.**

Once the deployment process is complete, you will see the Amazon CloudFront URL for the hosted Streamlit Application. Click on the link to access the application.


The chatbot interface will open in your default browser, ready for natural language interactions.

## Cleanup

1. Open [Amazon S3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/),  select `knowledgebase-XXXXXX` bucket and click on **Empty** bucket. Repeat the process for `codebuild-s3-source-xxxx` bucket.
2. Delete `knowledgebase-XXXXXX` and `codebuild-s3-source-xxxx` once they are empty.
3.  Open [AWS CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), delete `StreamlitServerlessApp-FrontendStack` and `amazon-bedrock-knowledge-base` stacks.
4. Open [Amazon CodeBuild](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects), delete `contextual-chatbot-with-aws-hosted-interface` project.
